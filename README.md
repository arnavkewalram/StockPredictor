## Usage

1. Basic usage:
```python
from stock_predictor import StockPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = StockPredictor()

# Train model
predictor.train_model(ticker="AAPL", start_date="2020-01-01", end_date="2023-12-31")

# Make predictions
predictions = predictor.predict_next_days(n_days=5)
```

2. Advanced usage with custom models:
```python
from src.models.neural_architectures import NeuralArchitectures
from src.models.model_optimization import ModelOptimizer

# Create custom model
architectures = NeuralArchitectures()
model = architectures.create_hybrid_model(input_shape=(60, 10))

# Optimize model
optimizer = ModelOptimizer()
optimized_model = optimizer.optimize_architecture(model)
```
